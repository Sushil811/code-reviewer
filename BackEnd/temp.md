❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){ retrun a+b;}
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ Missing parameters in the function definition. The function `sum` is intended to add two numbers but doesn't define
the input variables `a` and `b`.
* ❌ Typo in `return`. It's misspelled as `retrun`.
* ❌ No explicit return type or error handling.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:
* ✔ Parameters `a` and `b` are defined in the function signature.
* ✔ Typo corrected: `retrun` is now `return`.
* ✔ The function will now correctly add the two input numbers and return their sum.

Final Note:

Always ensure that function definitions include necessary parameters and that keywords are spelled correctly. This
prevents unexpected behavior and improves code readability.
