**Objective:**
This project is an automated code review tool designed to help developers write clean, efficient, and maintainable code. It streamlines the code review process by analyzing code against industry best practices, coding standards, and performance benchmarks. Developers can use it as a standalone service to review their code.

The tool provides feedback on several key aspects of code quality, including readability, security, performance, and consistency. It checks for common issues like redundant code, poor variable naming, inefficient algorithms, and potential security vulnerabilities. Additionally, it offers suggestions on improving code structure, adhering to design patterns, and implementing better testing practices.

Overall, this project enhances code quality, reduces manual review time, and promotes continuous learning and improvement in software development.
